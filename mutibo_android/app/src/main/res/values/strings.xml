    <string name="about_contents_howto"><b>How to play a single player game?</b>\nStart a game by choosing "Single player" in the main menu that is shown after logging in to the application.\n
\n<b>Objective of the game.</b>\n
Four movies are shown at a time. Three of those have a special relationship and one does not share this relationship. The objective is to identify the movie that does not fit in with the other three.
Touch your answer within the time time indicated by the blue bar on the bottom of the screen. You gain points by choosing the correct movie and loose a life when you choose incorrectly.\n
\n<b>Finishing the game.</b>\n
You start the game with three lives. The hearts on the top of the screen indicate the number of lives you have left.\n
The game ends when you have no more remaining lives or when you have answered all available questions in one go.\n
\n<b>How to play a multi player game?</b>\n
Sorry, multi-player games are not available in this release. Coming soon !\n\n <b>Leader board</b> You can check how your movie knowledge holds up to other players by visiting the leader board section of the app.</string>
